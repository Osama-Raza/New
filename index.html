<h1>The Story in the book</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<br>
<p>Molly had been starting out of her window an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New
        Scientist </em>
    ,and all the other scintific journal her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>on the road</cite>.
    It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt
    she needed to be free.
</p>
<p>She had spent the last years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
    that <q>Work in the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although may conssidered her pioneering
    work, unravelling
    of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,to be an outstanding achievement, Molly
    <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
